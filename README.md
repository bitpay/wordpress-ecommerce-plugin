# Troubleshooting

The latest version of this plugin can always be downloaded from the official BitPay repository located here: https://github.com/bitpay/wordpress-ecommerce-plugin

Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.
Verify that your web server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not recognize. Double check this on your firewall as well, if one is being used.
Check the system error log file (usually the web server error log) for any errors during BitPay payment attempts. If you contact BitPay support, they will ask to see the log file to help diagnose the problem.
Check the version of this plugin against the official plugin repository to ensure you are using the latest version. Your issue might have been addressed in a newer version!
If all else fails, send an email describing your issue in detail to support@bitpay.com
NOTE: When contacting support it will help us if you provide:

Wordpress Version
WP e-Commerce Version
Other plugins you have installed
